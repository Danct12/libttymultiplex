Description: Terminal multiplexer library
 libttymultiplex is a terminal multiplexing library.
 .
 It allows a program to create "panes", which are a
 rectangular area on the terminal/screen in which text
 can be  displayed. Each pane is like a small terminal,
 escape sequences can be sent to them.
 .
 libttymultiplex is also a xterm-compatible  but still
 incomplete terminal emulator. The libttymultiplex library
 allows for different backends for displaying stuff, which
 allows it to be used on any display device any of the
 backends support.
